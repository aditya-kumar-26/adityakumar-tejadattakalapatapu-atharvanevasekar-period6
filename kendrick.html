    <h1>Kendrick Lamar: Against All Odds</h1>
    <p>
      Hailing from the dangerous streets of Compton, California, Kendrick was
      surrounded by a myriad of influences: gang culture, crime, violence, and
      more. Yet, Kendrick persisted in his passion for writing and poetry.
      Kendrick’s experience being young is summarized in the title of his second
      studio album, “good kid, m.A.A.d city.” Through the success of his music,
      Kendrick was able to make it out of that environment and tell the stories
      of his life in his music. Each one of his studio albums are inspiring and
      thoughtful, and I have learned a lot from them.
    </p>
    <h3>Section.80</h3>

    <p>
      Section.80 is a social commentary on Kendrick’s generation. In it he
      covers themes such as racism, drug use, and the consequences of the Reagan
      era. This album made me a more socially aware person, as I now recognize
      the problems that plague the youth and young adults. It made me want to be
      cautious about social pressures and be more self-aware of my influences as
      well.

    <h3>good kid, m.A.A.d city</h3>

    <p>
      This album tells the story of Kendrick’s youth and how he tried to stay
      true to himself while being surrounded by many negative influences. In it
      are vivid images of life in Compton as a teenager and the struggles
      Kendrick faced, such as violence, alcoholism, peer pressure, and drug use.
      Kendrick’s tale is very inspiring as it demonstrates how someone can beat
      insurmountable odds; Kendrick refused to succumb to the pressures of
      Compton and instead realized he could be something bigger. It told me how
      I should live my life as well: staying true to myself no matter what
      surrounds me. It also reminded me that I should chase my dreams and
      passion, and I don’t have to do what everyone else says I should.
    </p>
    <h3>To Pimp A Butterfly</h3>

    <p>
      Often regarded as Kendrick’s magnum opus, TPAB is a generational work of
      art, covering various social and political themes, such as racism,
      corruption, greed, the allure of capitalism, and more. But ultimately, at
      its core, TPAB is a story of self-realization and finding your purpose in
      life. TPAB educated me tremendously on various issues in the United States
      and inspired me to find my purpose in life. Furthermore, as a musical
      accomplishment, how Kendrick infused hip-hop with jazz and funk is a great
      inspiration to my own interest in music production.
    </p>
    <h3>DAMN.</h3>
    <img src="damn.jpg" style="max-width: 25%; max-height: 25%" />
    <p>
      DAMN takes Kendrick down a much different musical path: instead of a grand
      statement, DAMN is a more scattered, introspective album. In it Kendrick
      details various parts of his psyche being one of the most critically
      acclaimed artists ever, along with strong personal religious themes. DAMN
      reminded me about the human condition that we all share, no matter how
      famous and rich you are. We all carry weight with us, whether that be our
      emotions, inner thoughts, or past experiences.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Overall, Kendrick’s life is a story of overcoming adversity, championing
      your beliefs, and chasing your dreams. Kendrick Lamar will continue to be
      one of my biggest inspirations for the rest of my life.
