      Kanye West: A Generational Icon
    </h1>
    <p class="mainpoint">
      Kanye West is perhaps the most famous artist of the decade. His influence
      is unparalleled and he is one of a kind. As a creative genius, he has
      dropped remarkable hip-hop albums one after another. Kanye’s message to
      the world is one about being yourself and believing in yourself. He is
      known for not caring what others think and striving for the vision he has
      in his mind. Kanye shaped the culture of our generation in both music and
      fashion; he is an inspiration to all of us.

        <h1 style="font-size: xx-large">808s & Heartbreak</h1>
        <p class="album1" style="width: 110%">
          Kanye’s 808’s and Heartbreaks was something unique. He pioneered the
          heavy use of autotune with his vocals on this album, along with being
          very emotionally vulnerable in a genre where that is not usually seen.
          It had never been done before, and many critics and music listeners
          were caught off guard. It was given bad reviews by critics, but many
          people appreciated his new style. After many years have passed, it
          created a whole new genre of rap, and with it, a new generation of
          rappers. They all used his techniques and sounds to make their own
          legacy. Rappers such as Juice WRLD, Drake, and Baby Keem are heavily
          influenced by what Kanye did on this album.

        <h1 style="font-size: xx-large">Yeezus</h1>
        <p style="width: 110%" class="album2">
          Yeezus was an experimental album by Kanye. It is very abrasive and
          harsh sounding, and sounds like it was produced in the future. He
          tried many different styles and sounds in this album, which makes it
          really stand out in his discography. It exposed his anger on the world
          and talked about important issues such as racism and materialism.
          Initially it didn’t meet the greatest reception because of its
          polarizing sound, but over time people grew on this album and it
          became an inspiration for other artists to learn to experiment with
          their sound. Yeezus became a symbol that artists look to as how one
          should push themselves out of their comfort zone.

        <h1 style="font-size: xx-large">Graduation</h1>
        <p style="width: 100%" class="album3">
          Kanye West’s Graduation was a very inspirational album. It motivated
          people to pursue their dreams and do what they love, no matter what
          people say about them. For example, Kanye dropped out of college to
          follow his passion for music, despite society disapproving of
          dropouts. He is now the most influential artist of our generation. His
          song, “I Wonder” encapsulates the message of the album perfectly, with
          the lyrics, “And I wonder if you know what it means to find your
          dreams come true.”

        <p style="width: 110%" class="album4">
          Highly regarded as his best album of all time, Kanye’s My Dark
          Beautiful Twisted Fantasy changed his career forever. Prior to this,
          he was drunk at the 2009 VMA Awards and ruined Taylor’s speech after
          she won her award. His PR took a nasty hit and many people and his own
          fans turned on him for this. He knew he messed up, so he went to
          Hawaii to work on his album, which turned his career around and
          brought him back into a good light. This album has grand, illustrious
          production to match its theme about life being famous. In the album,
          Kanye covers what it feels like to be famous: both the amazing highs
          and the terrible lows. Kanye shows a lot of vulnerability about his
          mistakes and admits to many of his character flaws. After this amazing
          piece of art, Kanye showed the world he is still someone worth rooting
          for.

        <p style="width: 110%" class="album5">
          Kanye is the richest black man on earth. This is mostly due to his
          brand, Yeezy, which started as a shoe brand but quickly turned into
          clothing of all types. He first signed with Nike in 2007. He made the
          first Yeezy shoe, which sold out within seconds due to limited
          quantity. This was the 1st exposure of Kanye to the fashion world, and
          he would continue to stay with Nike until 2013, where he signed with
          Adidas. He started making different types of Yeezys and had more
          freedom with Adidas. He still is with Adidas today, making Yeezys in
          relatively higher quantities. When Kanye first entered the fashion
          industry there were many naysayers who said he could not be
          successful; Kanye proved them wrong and showed us how we must have
          faith in our ideas, even if everybody tells us we can’t.

    <p class="mainpoint">
      Overall, Kanye's art is one of a kind, and he inspires others to believe
      in themself. Kanye once said in an interview: "Go listen to all my music,
      it's the codes of self-esteem. It's the codes of who you are. if you're a
      Kanye West fan, you're not a fan of me, you're a fan of yourself."
